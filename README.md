# Simple GitHub Actions Workflow Demo

This repository serves as a basic demonstration of a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Description

The primary purpose of this project is to illustrate how a simple workflow is triggered and executed using GitHub Actions. The repository contains a workflow file located in `.github/workflows/` that runs a simple "Hello, world!" script upon every `push` event to the repository.

Additionally, the repository contains an `email.json` file, which holds a user-specific email address. This is included as an example of how project-specific data might be stored.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Git must be installed on your local machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository. Replace `[YOUR_USERNAME]` and `[YOUR_REPOSITORY]` with the appropriate values.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY].git
    ```

## Usage

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to run automatically.

1.  Make any change to the repository (e.g., edit this `README.md` file).
2.  Commit and push your changes.
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Test workflow trigger"
    git push
    ```
3.  Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow run in real-time.

This project is intended as a learning tool. You can modify the workflow file at `.github/A simple workflow` to experiment with different GitHub Actions features.
